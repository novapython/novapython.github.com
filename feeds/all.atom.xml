We did seriously well. Our class has a very diverse range of skills. There are some who are installing their favorite IDE and running through the Django tutorial. There are a couple who have not used a command line before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those with no linux experience were looking at DEBUG dumps, and finding the problem in their code. Fixing the problem, then restarting the Django server. Thats pretty good. The amount of knowledge required to bring up a Django web site is pretty astronomical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes!&lt;/strong&gt; It really is when you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the push to teach everyone to code, you have to look at exactly what it takes to code. You have to have a text editor. Ubuntu doesn't have gedit on the standard toolbar. So just open a terminal and run gedit. But how do you know gedit exists? What are you even editing? Oh you should run django-admin.py? Whats a terminal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's biggest issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editing the text, by far. Moving from text editor to command line was time consuming and complex for those who had never done it before. This is where I would focus most of the setup time. An editor that autocompletes Python code, and can highlight syntax errors as you code. However! I have been told that these IDEs (Eclipse, looking at you) are pretty easy to &amp;quot;accidentally&amp;quot; break. Somebody changes a setting somewhere, and now you are out 10 minutes trying to figrue out what went wrong. Also, how does the student simulate that environment when they get back home? How do you load a virtualenv into the Eclipse configs, when you are just barely understanding what a virtualenv even is? You know what always works though? Vim :) &amp;lt;esc&amp;gt;i just keep typing&amp;lt;esc&amp;gt;:wq. And it works when you get home as well. You don't need to master anything. If something is weird, &amp;lt;esc&amp;gt;i. And you're back.... just a thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typos. This could be addressed by the IDE though. Highlight unknown variables. This would save a LOT of time, trying code paths until you hit that one typo, and then have to navigate your way back to that file. If you don't do this everyday, this is time consuming and frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we need a better editor. I think that would increase enjoyment. I'll have to wait for the post-workshop surveys to come back as well though.&lt;/p&gt;

Things are looking
up and our plan is solid. We will have some pretty sleek presentations
for our information as well. We discussed several things, most notably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Github pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common pitfalls of programming tutorials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dgentle Django's huge traction is getting us tens of views every single day,
so we need to make sure that the site is responsive. Item #1 leads to #2,
which is obviously the reason I am writing all this up. I just had to try out
Github pages. I am very pleased. I would like some ideas on themes for pelican,
but that will come soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on to the real meat, #3. We plan on starting out simple. The what and
why of web frameworks in general. This is necessary because Django is a
pretty large undertaking for a simple website. So you need to know why you
would choose Djhango in the first place. Knowing why will make all the
abstractions (MVC) make sense, instead of seeming like a hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Matt and I were discussing the two types of programming instruction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How install X and create a &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot; app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theory behind distributed credit card chargebacks when your backup ESB is on the fritz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a little bit of knowledge inbetween those two situations that is
rarely discussed. But the vast majority of people fall in between those two
scenarios. How do you reach them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. I don't know. But, I figure it's a good enough question to justify
throwing together a Github Pages account with a little bit of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/gekitsuu"&gt;&amp;#64;gekitsuu&lt;/a&gt; spoke about Rackspace and Python and Zombies. He covered Python integration with libcloud and MongoDB and how to work that into a Rackspace deployment. We all learned a little bit and had a lot of new faces in the crowd as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I announced the Dgentle Django class this August as well. The class sold out before midnight! It will be an amazing time I’m sure. We are finalizing the last details now, and will be updating everyone along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, my code is written in PHP, and my cloud is based on Rackspace...
so I strayed a little bit from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redmonocle.com/"&gt;Jen Rullmann's&lt;/a&gt; presentation, but its the thought that counts. The workshop last night went very well. We had several linux users, the ever growing Mac contingent was there, and we had Windows users as well. Yet, we still managed to get virtualenv and Django running locally on everyone’s system, and then pushed to EC2 using a Fabric config file. That is the same fabfile I modified to get my PHP code up and running on Rackspace. Fabric is pretty great and Jen’s example cut out a lot of tedious steps to learn the ins and outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a strong turnout. Deploying applications reliably across systems is a hot topic. It doesn’t matter if its AWS, VMware, Heroku or Rackspace, it seems to be what everyone wants to do. Getting a hands on tutorial was strong step in the right direction. Next we could delve into Fabric more. Explore more of the AWS services, hear from some of the other providers out there as well…. So until that next time..&lt;/p&gt;
