Things are looking
up and our plan is solid. We will have some pretty sleek presentations
for our information as well. We discussed several things, most notably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Github pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common pitfalls of programming tutorials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dgentle Django's huge traction is getting us tens of views every single day,
so we need to make sure that the site is responsive. Item #1 leads to #2,
which is obviously the reason I am writing all this up. I just had to try out
Github pages. I am very pleased. I would like some ideas on themes for pelican,
but that will come soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on to the real meat, #3. We plan on starting out simple. The what and
why of web frameworks in general. This is necessary because Django is a
pretty large undertaking for a simple website. So you need to know why you
would choose Djhango in the first place. Knowing why will make all the
abstractions (MVC) make sense, instead of seeming like a hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Matt and I were discussing the two types of programming instruction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How install X and create a &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot; app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theory behind distributed credit card chargebacks when your backup ESB is on the fritz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a little bit of knowledge inbetween those two situations that is
rarely discussed. But the vast majority of people fall in between those two
scenarios. How do you reach them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. I don't know. But, I figure it's a good enough question to justify
throwing together a Github Pages account with a little bit of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/gekitsuu"&gt;&amp;#64;gekitsuu&lt;/a&gt; spoke about Rackspace and Python and Zombies. He covered Python integration with libcloud and MongoDB and how to work that into a Rackspace deployment. We all learned a little bit and had a lot of new faces in the crowd as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I announced the Dgentle Django class this August as well. The class sold out before midnight! It will be an amazing time I’m sure. We are finalizing the last details now, and will be updating everyone along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, my code is written in PHP, and my cloud is based on Rackspace...
so I strayed a little bit from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redmonocle.com/"&gt;Jen Rullmann's&lt;/a&gt; presentation, but its the thought that counts. The workshop last night went very well. We had several linux users, the ever growing Mac contingent was there, and we had Windows users as well. Yet, we still managed to get virtualenv and Django running locally on everyone’s system, and then pushed to EC2 using a Fabric config file. That is the same fabfile I modified to get my PHP code up and running on Rackspace. Fabric is pretty great and Jen’s example cut out a lot of tedious steps to learn the ins and outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a strong turnout. Deploying applications reliably across systems is a hot topic. It doesn’t matter if its AWS, VMware, Heroku or Rackspace, it seems to be what everyone wants to do. Getting a hands on tutorial was strong step in the right direction. Next we could delve into Fabric more. Explore more of the AWS services, hear from some of the other providers out there as well…. So until that next time..&lt;/p&gt;
